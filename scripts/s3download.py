"""
Download raw HTML archived on in the AWS S3
mediacloud-downloads-backup bucket.

NOT a "pipeline worker"
(tho it could be made into one)
it runs one download at a time!

Database epochs B & D use overlapping download ids ("D" was created as
a stopgap after 32-bit story ids were exhausted, by restoring an old
backup, but without advancing the downloads_downloads_id_seq next
value to be clear of previously used values), BUT bucket versioning
was enabled, so it's possible to retrieve S3 objects based on their
LastModified time:

B: 2021-09-15 thru 2021-11-20
D: 2021-12-26 thru 2022-01-25

Daily CSV files extracted by C4A are in S3 buckets:
mediacloud-database-[b-e]-files

CSV is expected to contain:
collect_date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.uuuuuu])
downloads_id
url

May also contain: stories_id, media_id, feeds_id
